            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I'm a seasoned developer with a rich background in both traditional tech and the exciting realm of Web3. My professional journey includes impactful roles at Tarides and Mainflux Labs, where I deepened my expertise in systems engineering, GoLang development, and secure multi-party computation platforms. Transitioning to Web3, I embraced the challenges of decentralized finance, applying my skills to develop trading bots and delve into advanced concepts like MEV and OEV. My GitHub hosts a standout project using LSTM and Monte Carlo Simulations for cryptocurrency analysis, showcasing my proficiency in algorithmic trading and smart contract development. My experience, marked by a strong commitment to innovation and collaborative problem-solving, makes me a valuable asset in any Web3 development team.
